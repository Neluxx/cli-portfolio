    <p class="text-ubuntu-yellow font-bold mb-2">About Me</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Hey, my name is Fabian. I am a full-stack software developer from Germany.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I began my career with an apprenticeship in media design, which introduced me to web development and motivated me to pursue a degree in computer science. Since graduating, I have focused on software development, driven by curiosity and a commitment to continuously expand my knowledge of emerging technologies.</p>
    <p>I love clean code, open-source, and a good cup of coffee ☕</p>
